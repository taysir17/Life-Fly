## 🚀 Overview

The idea for **Life Fly** began during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when hospitals faced unprecedented challenges. Despite my aspiration to become a doctor, my journey took a different path, leading me to explore how technology could revolutionize healthcare. **Life Fly** is the realization of that dream, combining innovative concepts to address critical challenges in global healthcare.

### **Mission Statement**
To harness the power of technology to save lives by addressing two critical healthcare challenges: **organ transportation** and **emergency medical intervention.**

## 📜 Origin Story
At the age of 16, amidst the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, I envisioned a project that would leverage technology to transform healthcare. This vision became a reality during my second year at university, where I pitched this idea at the **Student Entrepreneurship Hub**. Today, Life Fly stands as a testament to the belief that technology must serve humanity.
